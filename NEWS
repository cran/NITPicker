NITPicker

10/01/19: As requested by a reviewer of the manuscript, an additional parameter has been added that lets biologists add the relative importance of genes.  

27/06/18: This new version has a few major changes.  Firstly, it was noticed that the 'fast mode' sometimes gave drastically different results compared to the 'un-fast mode'.  This has been fixed and now the fast mode produces much more stable results. Secondly, we added a mode that allows the user to run NITPicker on multiple genes at once.  

22/04/18: This version has a 'fast mode' which switches the order of the summation and integration in the f1, f2, and f3 estimates, which can improve the speed of the algorithm.  In addition, the previous version of f3 has the L-4 estimate instead of the L-2, but this bug has now been fixed.  

19/04/18: This version of the tool provides methods for identifying the best subset of time points to test under the f1, f2, and f3 metrics described in the vignettes.  Splines are used to interpolate between points prior to sampling from the probability distribution of functions, but it is currently not used to interpolate between points when calculating the L2 error as part of the dynamic programming algorithm in order to decrease the runtime.
